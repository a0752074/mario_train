# mario_train
## Project Description:
Developed a self-playing Super Mario agent that can navigate and complete levels without human intervention, utilizing deep learning techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Additionally, the agent was enhanced with an Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) to encourage exploratory behavior and improve performance.

## Key Achievements:

*Trained a Super Mario agent that can autonomously navigate through game levels
*Implemented CNNs to process game frames and RL techniques to learn optimal actions
*Utilized the DQN algorithm to train the agent on the reward signal from the game environment
*Integrated an ICM to facilitate exploratory behavior and improve overall performance
*Conducted extensive experiments to evaluate and fine-tune the agent's performance
## Technologies:

*Python
*PyTorch
*OpenAI Gym
*Super Mario Bros. NES emulator
